                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Successfully lead the team in record sales years totalling over $5million, and in inaugural retail campaigns such as Totes for Wildlife.<br>
                        Communication and driving sales were key here, a large team of 30 casuals and 4 part time staff were under my management, as well as a wider team of 75 in the Visitor Services team to which I was a leader.<br>
                        Key to the success of the team was communicating a large variety of product, and conservation campaigns to a wide variety of individual visitors.<br>
                        As well as in store, I worked to create a document to track units of uniform for over 300 staff at Melbourne Zoo through excel. Ended up using a bunch of macros and logic. Reignited my love for code!<br>
                        After six years at the zoo I found that the best approach was a visitor centric, relying on genuine and tailored interactions. It was my job to pass this on to my entire team of casuals!

                        Jobshared a position as Store Manager for the DFO Southwharf concept store, as well as Visual Merchandising for the Brooksfield section in 10 Myer locations across the Melbourne Metro area.<br>
                        Visual Merchandising was the main focus, as the areas for Brooksfield were managed most of the time by Myer staff, we needed to ensure a uniform style across locations.<br>
                        My job was to ensure all of our items were styled correctly, and grouped according to seasonal colour lines and fits.<br>
                        The joy in creating outfits, and dressing customers for formal events was awesome! I learned a lot about how to ask the right questions to find out exactly what customers wanted.<br>
                        Of course more communication was involved, as I often had to dress and work to the concensus of a large party of groomsmen for weddings and similar events.

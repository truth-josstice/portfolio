                        <p>The website you're looking at right now! <b>Congratulations to me!</b><br>
                        Our first assessment in regard to coding and designing a website. This included the use of multiple web pages, navigation for users, as well as use of animation.<br>
                        The languages used include HTML, CSS & SASS. I have also included and become familiar with importing assets from external websites such as <i>Google Fonts</i> and <i>Font Awesome</i> to style the website.<br>
                        We are also asked to make our website responsive for multiple device types, I have chosen to use portait orientation for both mobile and tablet devices, as well as desktop.<br>
                        Personally this started as a "desktop first" design which I then rolled changes into for different media.<br>
                        Content was not something which would be graded on this assessment, as it is mainly for the construction, semantics, and styling for the website not for the content itself. Therefore a few areas are still under construction, and some assets such as logos will not be completed until I have assessed what I would like to create.<br>
                        A lot of spicier coding is to come so as my journey continues I will update my portfolio with new skills! I'm especially excited for some more powerful tools like JS!

                        <h3>Wireframing Assessment - April 2025</h3>
                        <p>Our first assessment in regard to industry skills!<br>
                        We were encouraged to make low fidelity wireframes for our portfolio assessment. The result of which is what you're looking at right now!<br>
                        We were required to show clear navigation and use case for all elements, and also to create four distinct elements such as a header, footer, navbar and main section. We were also asked to create further wireframes for responsive design on multiple display types.<br>
                        I designed the desktop version of the wireframe first, and continued to creating the tablet and mobile versions. I decided to use device width as a guideline, as this would likely mean display should be relatively fine on all devices (who even browses a website in landscape on a mobile device?!)<br>
                        This was also my first assessment using Markdown which I used to create the brief document including some moodboarding and colour scheming!

                        We were encouraged to make low fidelity wireframes for our portfolio assessment. The result of which is what you're looking at right now!<br>
                        We were required to show clear navigation and use case for all elements, and also to create four distinct elements such as a header, footer, navbar and main section. We were also asked to create further wireframes for responsive design on multiple display types.<br>
                        I designed the desktop version of the wireframe first, and continued to creating the tablet and mobile versions. I decided to use device width as a guideline, as this would likely mean display should be relatively fine on all devices (who even browses a website in landscape on a mobile device?!)<br>
                        This was also my first assessment using Markdown which I used to create the brief document including some moodboarding and colour scheming!

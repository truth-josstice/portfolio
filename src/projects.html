                        <p>The website you're looking at right now! <b>Congratulations to me!</b><br>
                        Our first assessment in regard to coding and designing a website. This included the use of multiple web pages, navigation for users, as well as use of animation.<br>
                        The languages used include HTML, CSS & SASS. I have also included and become familiar with importing assets from external websites such as <i>Google Fonts</i> and <i>Font Awesome</i> to style the website.<br>
                        We are also asked to make our website responsive for multiple device types, I have chosen to use portait orientation for both mobile and tablet devices, as well as desktop.<br>
                        Personally this started as a "desktop first" design which I then rolled changes into for different media.<br>
                        Content was not something which would be graded on this assessment, as it is mainly for the construction, semantics, and styling for the website not for the content itself. Therefore a few areas are still under construction, and some assets such as logos will not be completed until I have assessed what I would like to create.<br>
                        A lot of spicier coding is to come so as my journey continues I will update my portfolio with new skills! I'm especially excited for some more powerful tools like JS!

                        <h3>Wireframing Assessment - April 2025</h3>
                        <p>Our first assessment in regard to industry skills!<br>
                        We were encouraged to make low fidelity wireframes for our portfolio assessment. The result of which is what you're looking at right now!<br>
                        We were required to show clear navigation and use case for all elements, and also to create four distinct elements such as a header, footer, navbar and main section. We were also asked to create further wireframes for responsive design on multiple display types.<br>
                        I designed the desktop version of the wireframe first, and continued to creating the tablet and mobile versions. I decided to use device width as a guideline, as this would likely mean display should be relatively fine on all devices (who even browses a website in landscape on a mobile device?!)<br>
                        This was also my first assessment using Markdown which I used to create the brief document including some moodboarding and colour scheming!

                        <p>Some classwork where we created some basic animations using CSS and SCSS/SASS.<br>
                        It was a code along session which we completed during a lecture, however mine is a little different as I experimented with some of the animations.<br>
                        We were introduced to the @keyframes animation functions in CSS and how to add them to elements from our very basic bubble HTML file.<br>
                        Also we had further opportunities to style and colour elements in CSS.<br>

                        <p>An excerpt from our Ed classwork involving the neon text effect, and more broadly the function of mixins in SASS.<br>
                        Text neon effects were added to elements to create the old school neon glow effect. Pretty cool little details depending on the kind of website you are creating, could definitely see myself using this in some content.

                        Classwork was focussed on how SASS is implemented with CSS to ensure a broader range of compatability<br>
                        We were required to show clear navigation and use case for all elements, and also to create four distinct elements such as a header, footer, navbar and main section. We were also asked to create further wireframes for responsive design on multiple display types.<br>

                        <p>First real swing into the magic of HTML!<br>
                        Boy this took me back to myspace days! All of the time taken to create one of a kind ugly hashed together and bashed up HTML code for your page! Those were the days!<br>
                        Not quite like riding a bike, but after a lot of trial and error I made the page described in our Ed content!<br>
                        Realistically content here didn't matter, but what better way to make myself chuckle and keep my spirits up in the excercise than through memes and humour!<br>
                        Really the coolest part was seeing a page completely from scratch become what I wanted it to! A great first excercise!

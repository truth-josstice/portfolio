### Moodboarding and Colour Scheme

#### Colour Scheme
I want this portfolio page to be cohesive in its design, and also for the colour scheme to have some longevity. For this I would use a Monochrome or Analogous theme with bold colours only being used for emphasis and animations.
Will stick to blues, purples and deep reds and reconsider as I go. Would like to use a gradient background for the main section from a slightly saturated blue to a desaturated grey blue.
Colours as below:
- Font Colours
    - Light to contrast dark background colours, dark to contrast light backgrounds
    - All sticking to theme colour pallette
- Header 
    - Darkest shade of chosen colour
    - Nav buttons to be light tint of chosen theme colour w/ dark shadow to pop
- Main
    - Background: Muted version of theme colour, gradient to grey in bottom right corner
    - Cards: Darker shade of chosen colour w neon glow border
- Footer
    - same colour as header to create clean and cohesive look

### Pages and Sections
___
#### Home page (index.html) 
Landing page with "about me" section, including hobbies and interests. Will be using Flexbox and card style divs to represent all sections as destinct and clear. 
Ideally use shadow and/or neon effect to add emphasis to each, with hover psuedoclass animations. 
Ideas for unique hover animations:
- Neon colour change effect on hover
- Scale increase on hover
- Grayscale all other cards on hover? 
	- This one would be a challenge as we haven't really covered this on any lessons, would look cool though to emphasise the one card!
